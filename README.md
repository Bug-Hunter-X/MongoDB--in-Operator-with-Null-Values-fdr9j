# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values. The `$in` operator behaves unexpectedly in these situations.

## Bug
The provided JavaScript code shows an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator, where the array includes a `null` value. This can lead to unexpected query results, potentially not including documents that should match.

## Solution
The solution involves handling the `null` values appropriately.  One approach is to remove `null` from the array or to use an alternative query strategy, possibly involving separate queries if null should be treated as a separate case.
